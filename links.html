<p>Radha Krishna's first literary mention was found in King Hala's Prakrit text Gatha Saptasati which is composed of 700 verses and was written in the 1st century CE.[24][25][26] Later, the popular Gita Govinda written by Jayadeva in 12th century CE widely depicted Radha and Krishna as a couple.[27][28][29]</p><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arjuna" target="_self" style="color:rgb(93, 245, 67)">Arjuna</a>
<p> Arjuna (Sanskrit: अर्जुन, IAST: Arjuna), also known as Partha and Dhananjaya, is a protagonist of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. In the epic he is the third of five Pandava brothers, from the lineage of the Kuru. In the Mahabharata War, Arjuna was a key warrior from the Pandava side and killed many warriors. Before the beginning of the war, his mentor Krishna gave him the supreme knowledge of the Bhagavad Gita to overcome his moral dilemmas.[1] Arjuna was the son of Kunti, the wife of Kuru King Pandu, and the god Indra, who fathered him due to Pandu's curse.</p><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhishma" target="_blank" style="color: rgb(246, 113, 184);">Bhishma</a>
<p>Bhishma (Sanskrit: भीष्म, romanized: bhīṣma, lit. 'mighty'),[1] also known as Pitamaha, Gangaputra, and Devavrata, is a major character of the epic Mahabharata. He was the supreme commander of the Kaurava forces during the Kurukshetra War of the epic. He was the only character who witnessed the entirety of the events of the Mahabharata, beginning from the reign of his father, King Shantanu of the Kuru kingdom. Bhishma was the stepbrother of Vyasa, the grandfather of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas. He was a prominent statesman of the Kuru Kingdom. He was born as the youngest son of the illustrious King Shantanu and goddess Ganga.</p><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karna" target="_parent" style="color: rgb(165, 7, 238);">Karna</a>
<p>Karna (Sanskrit: कर्ण, IAST: Karṇa), also known as Vasusena, Anga-raja, and Radheya,[2] is one of the main protagonists of the Hindu epic Mahābhārata.[3][4] He is the son of the sun god Surya and princess Kunti (mother of the Pandavas), and thus a demigod of royal birth. Kunti was granted the boon to bear a child with desired divine qualities from the gods and without much knowledge, Kunti invoked the sun god to confirm it if it was true indeed. Karna was secretly born to an unmarried Kunti in her teenage years, and fearing outrage and backlash from society over her premarital pregnancy, Kunti had no choice but to abandon the newly born Karna adrift in a basket on the Ganges, in the hope that he finds foster parents.[3][5] The basket is discovered, and Karna is adopted and raised by foster Sūta parents named Radha and Adhiratha Nandana[2] of the charioteer and poet profession working for king Dhritarashtra.[3]</p><br>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draupadi" target="_top" style="color: rgb(242, 63, 43);">Draupadi</a>
<p>Draupadi (Sanskrit: द्रौपदी, romanized: draupadī, lit. 'Daughter of Drupada'), also referred to as Krishnā, Panchali, and Yajnaseni, is the main female protagonist of the Hindu epic Mahabharata, and the wife of the five Pandava brothers—Yudhishthira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula, and Sahadeva.[1] She is noted for her beauty, courage, and polyandrous marriage.[2]

    In the Mahabharata, Draupadi and her twin brother, Dhrishtadyumna, were born from a yajna (fire sacrifice) organized by King Drupada of Panchala. Arjuna won her hand in marriage, but she had to marry the five brothers because of her mother-in-law's misunderstanding. Later, she became the empress of Indraprastha after Yudhishthira performed the Rajasuya ritual and achieved the status of the emperor. She had five sons, one from each Pandava, who were collectively addressed as the Upapandavas.[3]</p><br>
